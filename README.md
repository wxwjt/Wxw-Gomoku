# Wxw-Gomoku
Gomoku, or Five in a Row, is a two-player board game on a 15×15 grid. Players use black or white stones, with black moving first. They take turns placing one stone per turn on empty intersections. The goal is to be the first to form an unbroken line of five stones—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
